<p>The months originated as a way to mark time and break up the year into shorter periods based on the <b>Moonâ€™s</b> orbit around Earth. The word month is even derived from the word Moon.</p>
<p>As far as we know, months were first used in <b><i>Mesopotamia</i></b> sometime between the years 500 BCE and 400 BCE to measure the natural period related to the lunar month, or <b><i>synodic</i></b> month, which is the time it takes for the Moon to go through all the Moon phases.</p>
