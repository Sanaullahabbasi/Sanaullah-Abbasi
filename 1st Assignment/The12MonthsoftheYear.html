<p>A year is divided into 12 months in the modern-day <b> <i>Gregorian calendar</i></b>. The months are either 28, 29, 30, or 31 days long.</p>
<p>Each month has either 28, 30, or 31 days during a <b><i>common year</i></b>, which has 365 days. During <b>leap years</b>, which occur nearly every 4 years, we add an extra (intercalary) day, Leap Day, on 29 February, making leap years 366 days long.

This is to keep our current calendar aligned with the solar year and astronomical seasons marked by equinoxes and solstices.</p>
