        <h1 id="heading">Karachi<hr /></h1>
        <p>Karachi was a small <b>fishing</b> village when a group of traders moved there in the early 18th century from the decaying port of Kharak Bandar nearby. Besides the natural
         protection against monsoon storms, Manora Head furnished an excellent site for the defense of the harbour, and the <i>Talpura am카rs</i> who gained Karachi from the <b>kh훮n of Kal훮t</b>
         in 1795 erected a permanent fort on it. The settlement expanded rapidly and was already of significance when it was captured in 1839 by the British, who annexed it in 1842,
         together with the province of Sindh. It then became an army headquarters for the British and also began to develop from a fishing village into the principal port for the Indus
         River region.</p>
        <p><br />In 1843 a river-steamer service was introduced between Karachi and Mult훮n, about 500 miles up the Indus. <b><i>Port facilities were improved from 1854 onward</i></b>. In 1861 
        a railway was built from Karachi to Kotri, 90 miles upstream on the right bank of the Indus, <b>opposite Hyderabad</b>. In 1864 direct telegraph communications were established with London 
        and with the interior. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the importance of Karachi grew, and it became a full-fledged seaport. By 1873 it possessed an <b><i>efficien</i></b>t and well-managed 
        harbour.</p>
