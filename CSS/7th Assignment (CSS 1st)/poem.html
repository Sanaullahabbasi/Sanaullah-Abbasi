                <p> Then, it will be true.</p>

            <span class="f">
                <p> I wonder if it's that simple?</p>

            <span class="g">
                <p> I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="h">
                <p> I went to school there, then Durham, then here</p>
            </span>
            <span class="j">
                <p> to this college on the hill above Harlem.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="k">
                <p> I am the only colored student in my class.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="l">
                <p> The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem</p>
            </span>
            <span class="m">
                <p> through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,</p>
            </span>
            <span class="n">
                <p> Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,</p>
            </span>
            <span class="o">
                <p> the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator</p>
            </span>
            <span class="p">
                <p> up to my room, sit down, and write this page:</p>
            </span>
            <span class="r">
            It's not easy to know what is true for you or me at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what I feel and see
            and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
            hear you, hear me---we two---you, me, talk on this page. (I hear New York too.) Me---who? Well, I like to
            eat, sleep, drink, and be in
            love. I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. I like a pipe for a Christmas present, or
            records---Bessie, bop, or Bach. I guess being
            colored doesn't make me NOT like the same things other folks like who are other races. So will my page be
            colored that I write? Being
            me, it will not be white. But it will be a part of you, instructor. You are white--- yet a part of me, as I
            am a part of you. That's American.
            Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me. Nor do I often want to be a part of you. But we are,
            that's true! As I learn
            from you, I guess you learn from me--- although you're older---and white--- and somewhat more free.</p>
