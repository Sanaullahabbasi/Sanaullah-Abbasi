    <h1 id="heading"> What is Qurbani? </h1>
    <p>Qurbani is an <b>annual sacrifice</b> of an animal offered to Allah during the days of <b>Eid al-Adha</b>, marking the completion of Hajj.<br ></p>
    <p>This sacrifice commemorates the actions of the Prophet Ibrahim (as), when he was prepared to sacrifice his beloved son <b><i>Ismail (as) </i></b>
    after seeing in a dream that Allah (swt) wanted him to do so. However, the dream was a test from Allah, and He sent down a ram from 
    heaven to be sacrificed in Ismailâ€™s place.<br /></p>
    <p><b>By sacrificing an animal each year</b>, we are confirming that we are willing to sacrifice whatever Allah asks of us and to submit to Him completely.<br /></p>
